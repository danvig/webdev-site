  <!-- FAQ SECTION -->
  <section class="faq">
    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>How long does a typical website project take?</summary>
      <p>The time it will take to develop a website depends entirely on the scope as every project is different. A basic folio website, (Home, About, Services, Contact Us), will take around 3-6 weeks. Larger projects can take longer.
        This will all be discussed in our first consultation.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How much will my website cost?</summary>
      <p>As a Freelancer, I work on an hourly rate of AUD$40 plus an AUD$200 deposit at the beginning of the project as a guarantee. All work will be tracked with time cards to guarantee you're paying only
        for the amount of time I spent developing the project.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Will my site be mobile‑friendly?</summary>
      <p>Of course! In a world where a large percent of internet users are viewing through their phone, it's imperative that designs are mobile responsive. We design <strong>mobile‑first</strong> and test 
        across modern devices and browsers to ensure a consistent, accessible experience.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can I update the site myself after launch?</summary>
      <p>If that is what you wish, than yes. I will typically build a site using Wordpress which makes it easy for you to jump in and make whatever edits you need. I am happy to write
        documentation to assist you with this. Otherwise, if you prefer me to handle the maintenance, we can work out a payment structure for that.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What do you use to build websites?</summary>
      <p>Again, depends on the scope of the project. For a very basic one-page website, I'll likely use traditional HTML and CSS. For websites beyond that, I like to use
        Wordpress as it can streamline the process and allow for greater control over the design.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you use Wix to build websites?</summary>
      <p>I no longer use Wix to build websites. Some of my first websites were built using Wix, but it is a shocking UI for developing with and doesn't put
        mobile-friendly sites first. I advise shying away from it.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you handle domain registration and hosting?</summary>
      <p>I typically advise clients to buy their own hosting and register their own domains. For more reasons than one, but you can cut out the middleman and pay for it directly rather than through me, and if you decide in the future
        you want to move elsewhere you can change the DNS and Nameservers without having to contact me to pull it away. It also saves me having to chase a client every year to seek payment for the upcoming 
        invoice. However, I am happy to advise on hosting and domain registration.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do I need hosting and domain registration before we start?</summary>
      <p>I would advise if you have a website you're certain on being built, have the domain registered at a minimum so you can hold it. There's nothing like having
        a whole website developed with a name you want only to find out the domain has been built. For hosting, it depends on the tool being used to develop. For Wordpress,
        it typically requires hosting so we have somewhere to keep the site whilst developing. I can develop locally however if you don't want to pay for hosting until later.

        <br><br>

        For sites being built with traditional HTML/CSS, I can host the site on my own server during development so you can review it as I go and then once we're ready
        to deploy we can spin up your hosting and migrate the site there.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can you redesign my existing website?</summary>
      <p>Depeneds on the scope of the website and if it is within my skillset. But I can definitely consult with you regarding that and make use of the existing assets
        to create a new product.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you make e-commerce websites?</summary>
      <p>At the moment I do not offer e-commerce as I have yet to properly learn. But it is something I plan on offering eventually.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What if I need help after launch?</summary>
      <p>If you need help after launch, I charge an hourly rate (that accumulates and is paid monthly) for site updates, backups, maintenance, whatever you need.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How do we get started?</summary>
      <p>Send me an email with a basic outline of the scope of your project and I'll get back to you within 1-3 business days and we can schedule a free
        consultation call.
      </p>
